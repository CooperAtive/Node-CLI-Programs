For the FizzBuzz Assignment, I decided to teach myself some command line interface in Node.js
by running "node fizzbuzz.js" the program will prompt the user for input.

Input should be formatted like this:
3 Fizz, 5 Buzz, 10
OR
3 Fizz, 5 Buzz, 7 Sivv, 100
Generally it can take any number of comma separated "Flag Callout" arguments, followed by
the maximum number you want to program to print.

The first example would print:
1:
2:
3: Fizz
4: 
5: Buzz 
6: Fizz 
7: 
8: 
9: Fizz 
10: Buzz
